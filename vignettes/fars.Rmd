This package can be used to read and manage data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.

## Importing data

FARS data can be imported using the `fars_read` function:

```{r read}
library(fars)
file <- make_filename(2016)
fars_data <- fars_read(file)
```
